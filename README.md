# About
Welcome to the Metis repository! This project is dedicated to the design, manufacture, and control of a delta robot, entirely from scratch.


# Key Features
- *Custom 3D Printed Components*
- *URDF Description of the robot*
- *ROS2 Integration*
- *Micro-ROS on ESP32*

# Documentation
A more detailed documentation can be found [here](/docs/).
- **Mechanical components**: how the robot has been designed.
- **Electronics**: the bridge between the mechanics and the control software.
- **Software architecture**: how the project is structured and how to interact with the robot.
- **Inverse geometry**: Numerical inverse geometry, with Gauss-Newton optimization algorithm.
- **Trajectory generator**: Python class to generate velocity and acceleration constrained trajectories.
